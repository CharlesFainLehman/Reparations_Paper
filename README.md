This is the Github repository for data and replication code for my paper, "Who Pays for Reparations?," released by the Manhattan Institute DATE TK. URL TK.

Code for constructing the death estimates is in the Death Estimates/ folder. Code for constructing the birth estimates is in the Birth Estimates/ folder. Code for simulating population growth post-1860 absent immigration is in Population Estimates/. Charts are outputted to img/.

The birth estimates are dependent on the death estimates, and population estimates are dependent on both. Therefore, the scripts must be executed in order, as in Construct and Simulate.R.
